  summary: Trigger a bookmark
  description: >-
    This endpoint uses a bookmark to create events.


    Multiple events may be created, depending on the ```target```. HTTP bookmarks will trigger at most one event, whereas CLI bookmarks will generate as many events as there are CLI clients listening to the associated connection.


    > The parameter ```last_used_at``` is set to the current timestamp.

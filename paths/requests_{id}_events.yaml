  summary: Retrieve request events
  description: >-
    This endpoint retrieves the events associated with a request.


    ### Filtering events

    To filter the list of events, use only supported operators.


    For example, append ```?created_at[gte]=2021-10-12&created_at[lte]=2021-10-13``` to retrieve events for that specific 24-hour period.


    ### Including event data

    To retrieve events with their ```data``` populated, use the ```?include=data``` query parameter. Be aware that this can lead to very large responses.


    Payload data exceeding 2.5 MB won't be returned, and ```data.body``` will be set to ```null```. The request path, query and headers are still included.


    > To distinguish between these large payloads and payloads set to the JSON literal ```null```, leverage ```headers['content-length']```.


    ### Including CLI events

    CLI events are excluded from the results by default. To query CLI events, use ```/events?cli_id[any]=true```.

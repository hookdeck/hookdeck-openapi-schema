  description: >-
    # Getting started

    Our API allows you to set up your connections, retrieve your events and
    perform various actions such as retries.


    Explore our data, browse the descriptions of the available attributes and
    see examples of working requests and responses.


    >Hookdeck API was historically available on api.hookdeck.io and has been
    moved to api.hookdeck.com. The former will remain functional but consider
    migrating to api.hookdeck.com.

    ## Create your account

    To use the API, you'll need an API key that you can retrieve from your
    account. Sign in or sign up at
    [https://hookdeck.com/signin](https://hookdeck.com/signin). Each workspace
    is assigned a unique API key used to authenticate with Hookdeck.

    ## Authentication

    Use **Bearer Token Authentication** to authorize your request. The username
    is your API Key and the password is blank:


    Hookdeck uses API keys via Bearer Token to allow access to the API. You can
    retrieve your Hookdeck API key in your
    [dashboard](https://hookdeck.com/dashboard/api).


    Hookdeck expects your API key to be included in all your API requests to the
    server in the header. It would look like the following:


    ```Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY```

     > You must replace ```$API_KEY``` with your personal API key.

    > Basic Authentication is also supported with the API key as username and
    empty password

     ```
    curl "https://api.hookdeck.com/2022-03-01/events"
       -H "Content-Type: application/json"
       -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY"
     ```

    # Paging

    All `GET` endpoints to retrieve a list of resources are paged using cursor
    (keyset, seek) pagination.


    To work with Cursor paging all the necessary information will be contained
    in the response body `pagination` object.

    <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Parameter</th>  <th>Default</th>
    <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>order_by</td>
    <td><code>"created_at"</code></td> <td>The sortable key to use (options
    varies base on the resource)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>dir</td>
    <td><code>"desc"</code></td> <td>The direction to sort it
    (<code>"asc"</code> or <code>"desc"</code>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>limit</td>
    <td><code>100</code></td> <td>The making amount of results returned per
    query (max: <code>250</code>)</td> </tr> <tr> <td>next</td>
    <td><code>undefined</code></td> <td>The ID / cursor to provide in the query
    to get the next set of results</td> </tr> <tr> <td>prev</td>
    <td><code>undefined</code></td> <td>The ID / cursor to provide in the query
    to get the previous set of results</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>

    Unless you have specified an `order_by` or `dir`, you can omit it from the
    next or previous set query. You only have to carry them over if you are not
    using the resource default.

    > If an event is pending, the keyset will return a truthy value (null) which
    will cause the pagination to omit null values in the response.


    Example pagination object:

    ```

    {
      "pagination": {
        "order_by": "created_at",
        "dir": "desc",
        "limit": 100,
        "next": "web_2urj7h9puxk6obro3x",
        "prev": "web_2urj7h9puxk6obuf6i"
      }
    }

    ```


    Example to get the next page:

    ```

    curl
    "https://api.hookdeck.com/2022-03-01/connections?next=web_2urj7h9puxk6obro3x"
      -H "Authorization: Basic BASE64_API_TOKEN"
    ```


    Example to get the previous page:

    ```

    curl
    "https://api.hookdeck.com/2022-03-01/connections?previous=web_2urj7h9puxk6obuf6i"
      -H "Authorization: Basic BASE64_API_TOKEN"
    ```


    Example to get the next page without using the default ordering:

    ```

    curl
    "https://api.hookdeck.com/2022-03-01/connections?order_by=updated_at&dir=asc&next=web_2urj7h9puxk6obro3x"
      -H "Authorization: Basic BASE64_API_TOKEN"
    ```

    # Errors

    Hookdeck uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or
    failure of an API request. In general, codes in the 2xx range indicate
    success, codes in the 4xx range indicate an error that resulted from the
    provided information (e.g., a required parameter was missing), and codes in
    the 5xx range indicate an error.

    ## Response

    With any HTTP error, the response body will contain a few properties.

    <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Parameter</th> <th>Type</th> <th>Description</th>
    </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>handle</td> <td><code>boolean</code></td>
    <td>Error was handled by the API and did not resolve in an uncaught
    exception.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>status</td> <td><code>integer</code></td>
    <td>HTTP Status of the error</td> </tr> <tr> <td>message</td>
    <td><code>string</code></td> <td>Message associated with the error, could be
    more or less specific depending on the error</td> </tr> <tr> <td>data</td>
    <td><code>object</code></td> <td>Data related to the error, useful for
    diagnostics</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>


    ## Error Codes

    <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Status Code</th> <th>Explanation</th> </tr>
    </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>200</td> <td>Good Request -- Your request is
    valid.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>400</td> <td>Bad Request -- Your request is
    invalid and could not be understood.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>401</td>
    <td>Unauthorized -- Your API key is wrong.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>403</td>
    <td>Forbidden -- The resource requested access is restricted.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>404</td> <td>Not Found -- The resource could not be found.</td>
    </tr>    <tr> <td>413</td> <td>Payload Too Large -- The payload is larger
    then the 100Kb limit</td> </tr>         <tr> <td>422</td> <td>Unprocessable
    Entry -- Your request was understood but contains invalid input.</td> </tr>
    <tr> <td>429</td> <td>Too Many Requests -- The request limit for that time
    period has been reached</td> </tr>        <tr> <td>500</td> <td>Internal
    Server Error -- We had a problem with our server. Try again later.</td>
    </tr>            <tr> <td>503</td> <td>Service Unavailable -- We're
    temporarily offline for maintenance. Please try again later.</td>
    </tr>                </tbody> </table>


    Example response from an error:

    ```

    {
      "handled": true,
      "status": 422,
      "message": "Webhook does not exist or is archived",
      "data": {
        "id": "web_xxxxxxxxxxx"
      }
    }

    ```

    # Rate Limits

    Hookdeck's Admin API has a rate limit of 240 request per minute per API key.
    Contact us if you need your rate limit to be increased.


    Each request will return the following headers:

    <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Header</th> <th>Explanation</th> </tr> </thead>
    <tbody> <tr> <td>Retry-After</td> <td>Seconds before next request can be
    made</td> </tr> <tr> <td>X-RateLimit-Limit</td> <td>Request per minute limit
    for the API key</td> </tr>         <tr> <td>X-RateLimit-Remaining</td>
    <td>Remaining request for the rate limit period</td> </tr> <tr>
    <td>X-RateLimit-Reset</td> <td>ISO timestamp of the next rate limit period
    reset</td> </tr> </tbody> </table>


    # Query Formatting

    ## Arrays

    Arrays are supported for query parameters indicated by `[]` appended to
    their type. Ex: `string[]`


    Arrays should be encoded as `?item[1]=hello&item[2]=world` which will be
    parse to `["hello", "world"]`

    ## Date

    Dates are expected to be in ISO format ex: `2021-01-21T20:16:28Z` or
    `2021-01-21`.

    ## JSON

    Some query params take `JSON` as input. The JSON should be stringified and
    URL encoded into a string.


    ex: `?body=%7B%0A%20%20"hello"%3A%20"world"%0A%7D` which will be parsed to
    `{ "hello": "world" }`


    # Operators

    Most query parameters for `GET` endpoints to retrieve a list of resources
    support query operators. The operators are:


    <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Parameter</th> <th>Supported Types</th>
    <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>gte</td>
    <td><code>date</code> <code>number</code></td> <td>Greater or equal
    than</td> </tr> <tr> <td>gt</td> <td><code>date</code>
    <code>number</code></td> <td>Greater than</td> </tr> <tr> <td>lte</td>
    <td><code>date</code> <code>number</code></td> <td>Lesser or equal than</td>
    </tr> <tr> <td>lt</td> <td><code>date</code> <code>number</code></td>
    <td>Lesser than</td> </tr> <tr> <td>any</td> <td><code>date</code>
    <code>number</code> <code>string</code></td> <td>Not <code>null</code></td>
    </tr> <tr> <td>contains</td> <td><code>string</code></td> <td>Contains</td>
    </tr> </tbody> </table>


    Example pagination object:


    ```

    {
      "pagination": {
        "order_by": "created_at",
        "dir": "desc",
        "limit": 100,
        "next": "web_2urj7h9puxk6obro3x",
        "prev": "web_2urj7h9puxk6obuf6i"
      }
    }

    ```

    # Changelog

    When backwards-incompatible changes are made to the API, a new, dated
    version is released. The latest version is, `2022-03-01`.


    The API version can be set in the base path of any endpoint such as
    `https://api.hookdeck.com/2022-03-01/sources`.


    If your request doesn't include a version, then the API also defaults to the
    oldest supported stable version.


    The backward incompatible changes are listed bellow for each version.
    Forward-compatible changes donâ€™t need a new API version and will not appear
    in this list.

    ## 2022-03-01

      - Removed the `interval` property from the Alert Rule. Alert rule now controls how new issues are opened and notifications are now triggered by an issue opening or re-opening.

    ### Introducing Issues

      - You can now use the Issues API to retrieve, update, and dismiss problems within your workspace.

    ### Introducing Notifications by Webhook

     - You can now use the Notifications API to configure webhook notifications for your workspace.

    * * *

    ## 2021-08-01
      - Removed the `label` property for Sources, Destinations, Rulesets and Connections.
      - Renamed the `alias` property to `name` for Sources, Destinations, Rulesets and Connections.
      - Removed the `alert_strategy` and `alert_interval` property for Rulesets.
      - Removed the `retry_strategy`, `retry_interval` and `retry_count` property for Rulesets.
      - Removed the `filters` property for Connections.
      - Added the `rules` property to Connections and Rulesets.

    ### Introducing Rules

    The removed properties of Rulesets and Connections have been replaced by the
    rules array. Each rules has a type and a set of property to configure it's
    behavior. Rules definitions are found here

      A webhook connection is used to join a source, a destination, and a
      ruleset.


      **Note:** *Connections historically were labeled "webhooks"*.


      *The endpoint root path ```/webhooks``` has been moved to
      ```/connections```*.


      *The former will remain functional but consider migrating to
      ```/connections```.*
  - name: Sources
    description: >-
      The Source object represents the third party sending the webhooks.


      Each source will provide you with a unique Hookdeck `URL` where the
      webhooks can be set to be ingested by Hookdeck.


      Each valid HTTP request received at that URL creates an `Event`.
